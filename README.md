# knapsack-problem

The knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and mathematics. It involves trying to fit a set of items into a knapsack, with each item having a certain weight and value. The goal is to maximize the value of the items included in the knapsack while keeping the total weight of the items below or equal to the knapsack's capacity.
